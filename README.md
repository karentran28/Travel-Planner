# **My Personal Project**

## *Travel Itinerary Planner*

The overall idea of my project is to create an application that assists users in planning and organizing their travel
trips. It is tailored to individuals who have any upcoming trips with the intention of traveling to various
places with numerous daily activities. It can help organize and breakdown what each day will look like during their
trip. It will also allow them to get an estimate on the cost of the trip by including a breakdown of different 
categories of where their expenses are being used such as flights, accommodations, foods, activities, other etc.

I got interested in creating this project after travelling this past summer to Asia. My friends and I spent a lot of 
time planning our trip and using multiple platforms to organize the trip including Google Docs and Microsoft Excel. The
idea of a travel itinerary planner came to mind after reminiscing about the trip, realizing how beneficial a program
could be in organizing our travel plans. I plan to go on many more trips in the future so this project will 
undoubtedly be useful once completed!
